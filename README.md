Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project implements machine learning models to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using the Fraud Detection Dataset.
Due to the high class imbalance, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) was applied to balance the dataset before training.

📌 Dataset
Train set shape: (6226, 23)
Test set shape: (4667, 23)
Target column: is_fraud (0 = Legitimate, 1 = Fraud)

⚙ Workflow
Import required libraries
Load training and testing datasets
Remove non-numerical columns
Handle class imbalance using SMOTE
Scale features with StandardScaler
Train multiple models:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Evaluate results with:
Confusion Matrix
Classification Report
ROC-AUC Score

📊 Observations
Logistic Regression failed to classify legitimate transactions (all predicted as fraud).
Decision Tree and Random Forest classified legitimate transactions well but completely failed on fraud detection due to extreme class imbalance.
ROC-AUC scores are ~0.5, indicating poor discrimination ability.
🚀 Future Improvements
Use ensemble methods like XGBoost or LightGBM.
Apply advanced resampling techniques (e.g., SMOTEENN, ADASYN).
Engineer additional fraud-related features.
Try deep learning models for anomaly detection.
